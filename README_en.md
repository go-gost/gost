## Overview

![Overview](https://gost.run/images/overview.png)

There are three main ways to use GOST as a tunnel.

### Proxy

As a proxy service to access the network, multiple protocols can be used in combination to form a forwarding chain for traffic forwarding.

### Port Forwarding

Mapping the port of one service to the port of another service, you can also use a combination of multiple protocols to form a forwarding chain for traffic forwarding.

### Reverse Proxy

Use tunnel and intranet penetration to expose local services behind NAT or firewall to public network for access.
